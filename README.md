# Trevor Final Project

A front end to help with Trevor's final project for CS 101. 
This is a tool to easily calculate how much much everyone owes each other after an event such as a vaction.

## Running locally
This assumes one has npm installed. 
I recommend installing npm using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) so one can easily switch between different node versions. 

```sh
npm i 
npm start
```

Then using a browser open the url http://localhost:3000.
